4.	Benefit of Service 


A successful Web site is about marketing, generating revenue, and maximizing brand equity. A highly effective Web site should be crafted by a team of knowledgeable, creative business and marketing professionals, copywriters, graphic designers, and programmers. The benefits of your services or products should be clearly seen with the use of crisp, clean content and imagery in an attractive format with easy-to-use navigation. 

An ever-changing online environment 


New trends, technologies, expectations, etc., demand that your site be interactive and constantly updated. Having a static site is a sure way to end up in the Web site wasteland. Customers want to see new information, news, reviews, products and services, success stories, blog entries, press releases, pictures, and more. Google places a high value on pages that are updated frequently and on newly added Web pages. To keep up with the rapid pace of technological change and customer expectations, HEURISTIC COMMUNICATION PVT. LTD. has a full suite of Web tools and ideas to enhance your online image. 

A customizable approach that works — for brand exposure and search marketing 

HEURISTIC COMMUNICATION PVT. LTD. has watched the Internet emerge as a new media and grow from a novelty to the world’s most influential marketing and communication tool. We have used our design and marketing experience to pioneer new ways to brand companies using both traditional and new media. 




All sites are NOT created equal

There is a HUGE disparity in design and coding among various Web sites. Given the abundance of “template-style” sites and “Web shops” with little to no marketing or design expertise, it is hard for companies to realize the value and impact that a well-designed Web experience can have on customers and on the company’s sales. At HEURISTIC COMMUNICATION PVT. LTD. , our goal is to make our customers money, not cost them money.

Web Designing Life Cycle


Process Model/Software Life Cycle


Many clients have asked us how the process actually works and what happens throughout the website development. This document explains the process from start to finish and gives you an idea of what you could expect when working with us.

This is just a guideline; your project may have needs that are not addressed here.


2.	Project Kick-Off/Requirement Gathering Phase


2.1 Requirement Analysis


Based on the information you provided when requesting your website design quote, we attempt to determine your needs, what you are expecting from your website, and try to get a feel for your industry. This is why it is important for you to be as detailed as possible when requesting your quote.

We may have questions for you to help clarify certain issues and we will express those before quoting on your project. We will send a Design requisition form which will give us rough idea of the project requirement.

If we believe that your website development project could benefit from our services and skills, we will quote you on your project.

2.2 Website Development Contract


Once we have come to an agreement on project details, timeline and price, we will prepare a website development contract for you to review, sign and send back with your deposit.

2.3 Initial Deposit


The signed contract and 30% deposit is required before we schedule a time slot for your project. The remainder of your balance will be due upon project completion. Once we have received the 20% deposit and signed contract, we will provide you with a copy of the fully executed contract, a receipt for your deposit and your project start date, end date and number of man hour required to complete your project.

3.	Domain name registration / Website Hosting


If needed, we will immediately secure your desired domain name (pending availability) and include the first 1 years of service. The domain is registered in your name with your information and you will be the only registrant contact on file.

If you require hosting services, we can also provide you hosting services as per your Requirement of mail server, ftp severs, software support and sub-domain support. Both these services are reserved or booked for one year which needs to be renewed every year.

Graphic Design Phase 

4.1 Project Begins 

Upon receipt of your deposit and contract (if applicable), the Project Manager in-charge of your project will email you to confirm receipt of your deposit/contract, give you their direct contact information and possibly provide a list of items which will be needed from you over the course of development.

You will need to let us know the navigation links you would like (such as home, about us, services, etc) and supply all text and/or product information to be included on your site. In addition, you may also supply material such as company logo, personal photos, etc, if desired.

If you have any guide sites you would like us to refer to when designing your site or if you have any preference as to colors, style, etc please offer that information as well. Ideally, all of the above information should be supplied prior to us getting started. Work will commence on your scheduled start date. The developer in charge of your project will contact you on that day to confirm that we are getting started.

4.2 Custom Designed Website Concepts


We will provide possible 4-5 custom designed home page concepts for your project. In most cases, we will be able to provide these designs within 3-5 business days following your start date.

After you have reviewed the designs and decided which one you would like to use, we will continue to make modifications to the design until the final desired look is achieved. Once the final desired look is achieved, we will create the interior page layout, convert the design to HTML and start adding programs.

During this process, you will have the opportunity to review progress.


4.3In Progress Viewing


We establish a private directory for your new website on our testing server so that you may view the website development progress at any time. In addition, the project manager will inform you via email when extensive updates to the site have been made so you can review the most recent progress.

4.4Website Development / Code Phase


4.4.1.	Programming / Coding 


All website development programming/coding to run any special features/visitor interactivity on your website is completed and tested. 


4.4.2.	Website Pages 


Based upon your contract and the final design you selected, we create as many static or dynamic pages as needed to complete your site. 

4.4.3.	Website Navigation 


Navigation links or drop down menus, and rollover effects, if desired, are completed. 

4.4.4.	Site Map 


Creation of a site map page is done which includes easy one-click access to all pages of your site. 

4.4.5.	Site Content 


Incorporation of your logo, photos and text content is included in all projects. Custom logo design is available for an additional fee, please inquire if interested. 

4.4.6.	CSS Stylesheet 


CSS Stylesheet are used to define font faces, styles, sizes and colors for consistency throughout the site. 

4.4.7.	Website Favicon 


A favicon is a small image that displays in the address bar and on the favorites menu when someone bookmarks or adds your website to their "Favorites". Creation of a favicon is not included in all custom website development projects. If you want this feature then you have to pay an extra amount. 

4.4.8.	Response Forms / Email Contact Forms 


We always recommend at least one contact form for your visitor’s convenience. Using a contact form, a visitor can email you directly from your website without needing to open their email program. This is especially convenient if a visitor is not using their own computer when their email program is not available. 

Testing Phase 


5.1 Search Engine Readiness Check


Meta Tags, Page Titles, Page Heading, Alt Image Tags, Link Text, and Page Body Text evaluation and adjustment where needed throughout the website. At no time can we guarantee when or where the search engines will place your website within their search results or directory.

Browser Compatibility Testing

Your website is tested on a variety of operating systems and browsers to insure proper display and functionality.

7.	Grammar & Spell Check

Before the website is launched, a grammar and spell check is performed to insure there are no mistakes.

8. Dead Link Check


A thorough check for misdirected links and missing files is performed just prior to as well as after the launch of the website.

9. Forms / Programming


Any email contact forms and/or programming features included in your project are tested to confirm they are functioning as required.

10.	Launch Phase 


10.1	Final Payment 


Final payment is always due before we take the website live on your domain. Upon receipt of final payment, you will be emailed a final/paid in full receipt.

10.2	Launch Website 


All necessary website files and scripts are copied to your domain and databases are setup.

10.3	Error Testing 


After the website is live, any interactive programming and scripts are tested to verify proper function. Since the design and testing phase often occurs on a different server, it is very important to once again verify that everything is working correctly after taking the website live.

10.4	Website Files 


After launch and testing of the website, you are provided with a zipped archive of all website files.

10.5	Instructions & Documentation 


When necessary, any documentation needed to use the administration functions of your website is included in PDF format.



10.6	Search Engine Submission 


Hand submission and automated search engine submission occurs after launching, testing and fixing any issues there may have been.
