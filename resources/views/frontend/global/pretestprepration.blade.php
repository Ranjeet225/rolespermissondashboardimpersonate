							<h4>University Test Preparation </h4>
							<p class="about-content">
							University Test is the stage in survey research when survey questions and questionnaires are tested on members of target population/study population, to evaluate the reliability and validity of the survey instruments prior to their final distribution. It incorporates a variety of methods or combinations of methods.
							<br>
							University Test is widely regarded as indispensable in survey questionnaire development and is also crucial to improve data collection for quality-of-life research.
University Test is the process of bringing together members of the priority audience to react to the components of a communication campaign before they are produced in final form.
University Test measures the reaction of the selected group of individuals and helps determine whether the priority audience will find the components - usually draft materials understandable, believable and appealing.
							</p>
							<h3>Components of a communication campaign that benefit from University Test include:</h3>
